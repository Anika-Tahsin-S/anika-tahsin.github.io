Developed a lightweight medical image segmentation pipeline on Kaggleâ€™s MRI dataset.
Converted 3D NIfTI volumes to 2D slices, applied z-score normalization, and binarized masks (nearest-neighbor). 
Trained a U-Net with a MobileNetV2 encoder (PyTorch/SMP) using BCE+Dice, mixed precision (AMP), gradient clipping, cosine LR, and early stopping. 
Evaluated with Dice/IoU/Precision/Recall/F1 and performed a threshold sweep to optimize inference.
