## CVIS Hands‑On Training: Practical Machine Learning & Computer Vision
**Location:** BRAC University (CVIS Lab) &nbsp;|&nbsp; **Instructor:** Anika Tahsin  
**Pre‑requisites:** Comfortable with Python; basic linear algebra and probability helpful

### Course Description
A practitioner‑oriented workshop on building end‑to‑end ML/CV/LLM pipelines. Students learn dataset creation and curation, exploratory data analysis, visualization, image preprocessing, and modern deep learning for **object detection** and **segmentation**. Emphasis is placed on reproducible workflows, evaluation, and error analysis.

## Research Guidelines & Thesis Mentoring (Undergraduate)
**Audience:** Final‑year students beginning or refining their thesis in AI/ML/CV

### Mentoring Scope
- **Problem Formulation:** Narrowing research questions; constructing baselines and ablations  
- **Data & Ethics:** Dataset documentation, licensing, bias assessment, and IRB‑style considerations  
- **Methodology:** Reproducible pipelines (code structure, configs, seeds), evaluation metrics, and reporting standards  
- **Writing:** Storyboarding papers, drafting figures, and preparing rebuttals  
- **Open‑Source Practice:** Clean READMEs, environment files, model cards, and result logs

<!-- ### Typical Workflow & Milestones
1. **Proposal (Week 1–2):** 1‑page problem statement, baseline plan, timeline  
2. **Prototype (Week 3–5):** Minimal working model + data card  
3. **Evaluation (Week 6–8):** Metrics, error analysis, and ablations  
4. **Paper Draft (Week 9–10):** 6–8 pages with figures, tables, and limitations  
5. **Presentation (Final):** 12–15 slides; live demo if applicable -->

**Resources:** Template for project structure, LaTeX paper skeleton, and result‑logging worksheets can be shared on request.

## Undergraduate Tutor (BRAC University)
**Courses:**  
- **MAT 110 — MATH I: Differential Calculus & Co‑ordinate Geometry**  
- **PHY 111 — Principles of Physics I**

### Role & Focus
- Held problem‑solving sessions, clarified core concepts, and designed short practice sets.  
- Emphasized intuition, step‑by‑step derivations, and exam‑style reasoning.  
- Provided individualized study plans and quick diagnostic checks.

**Common Topics Covered**
- *MAT 110:* Limits, continuity, derivatives, optimization, curve sketching, coordinate geometry  
- *PHY 111:* Kinematics, Newtonian mechanics, work–energy, momentum, rotational dynamics, basic oscillations

**Assessment Support**
- Weekly problem clinics, review sheets, and past‑paper walkthroughs.
