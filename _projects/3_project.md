- Modeled wildfire scale using historical meteorological and temporal features.
- Compared linear/tree-based regressors with shallow neural networks; conducted ablations on feature subsets.
- Performed error analysis, calibration checks, and residual diagnostics to refine generalization.

**Repo:** [GitHub](https://github.com/Anika-Tahsin-S/Wildfire-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning)

**Highlights**
- Models: Linear regression, RandomForest/XGBoost, shallow NNs
- Pipeline: Feature engineering, scaling, CV, hyperparameter search
- Metrics: MAE, RMSE, RÂ²; calibration and error slicing
