- Built a YOLOv10 pipeline to detect ships in aerial images under scale and background variability.
- Curated dataset, designed a custom DataLoader, and performed hyperparameter tuning for accuracy/latency trade-offs.
- Trained with standard augmentations and evaluated using mAP, precisionâ€“recall, and confusion analysis.
- Profiled inference for real-time feasibility with post-processing (NMS) configuration.
